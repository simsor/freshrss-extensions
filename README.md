# FreshRSS extension repository

This repository contains all my extensions for the [FreshRSS](https://freshrss.org/) project, a free and open-source web-based feed reader.

Each extension is in its own folder.

## Installing an extension

You can [download this repository as a ZIP file](https://github.com/simsor/freshrss-extensions/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) or clone it with Git to get the latest version of the extensions.

```
$ git clone git@github.com:simsor/freshrss-extensions
```

Then, move the folders you want to install to the `extensions` folder in your FreshRSS installation directory.

Finally, activate the extensions from "âš™ > Configuration > Extensions", or visit https://localhost/p/i/?c=extension

Be careful, some extensions require you to configure them before they can work!
