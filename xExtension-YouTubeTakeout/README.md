# xExtension-YouTubeTakeout

FreshRSS extension to import a Google Takeout export of a user's Youtube subscriptions. 

A Google Takeout can be initiated from [https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout](https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout). Subscription data can be included by making sure "subscriptions" is checked under the "YouTube and YouTube Music" header. The resulting file should be named "subscriptions.csv", or equivalent in your language.

Once enabled, you can initiate an import by going to the "YouTube Takeout" menu under "Configuration".

Once your import is done, you can disable the extension and/or remove it without issue.
